# LoggiX

<p>
   LoggiX is a bleeding-edge logging program designed to be quick to learn and use
   But still be just as useful for contests as it is for casual logging!

<p>
  Some features include:
    1. Qrz.com integration for trans-device log synchronization and in app lookups
    2. Advanced type recognized dupe checking
    3. modern UI that includes log history AND everything needed to use it as contesting software too!
    4. Cabrillo format support
    5. advanced local log storage systems using the custom made .hlf or .hlfv2 log formats
    6. open-source for ever! You will never see this being sold for $100+ as proprietary code!
